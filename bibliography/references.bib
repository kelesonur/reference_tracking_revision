	abstract = {This study examined the relationship between identity patterns and the communication modes of deaf adolescents aged between 14 and 18 years in Turkey. They were currently being educated in state residential secondary schools for the deaf. Deaf adolescents were administered the ‘Deaf Identity Scale’ presented in Turkish using total communication modes. The instrument measuring identity choice was administered to 90 students at three residential state schools for the deaf. Based on the questionnaire responses, students were classified into three groups: those with a predominant Culturally Hearing Identity, those with a primary Culturally Deaf Identity, and those who identified with both groups – a Bicultural (Dual) Identity. Analyses focused on the relationship between the students’ identities and the communication methods which they reported using. The data indicated that the dual identity was consistently associated with better communication and the use of combined modes. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {We aim to demonstrate the importance of defining linguistic phenomena by using constructed action or {CA} (i.e. a stretch of discourse that represents one role or combination of roles depicting actions, utterances, thought, attitudes and/or feelings of one or more referents) as an example. The problem is that different assumptions about {CA} have led to some apparent contradictions about the nature and characteristics of this phenomenon. Based on observations and analyses of British Sign Language narrative data, we outline criteria and recommendations for defining and annotating {CA}. We show that, in carefully defining the phenomenon in question and providing criteria for its identification, applying these criteria to usage data leads to emergence of particular types of {CA}. We also show how identifying these types can help resolve some of the apparent contradictions in the literature.},
